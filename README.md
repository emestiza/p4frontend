## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build an information database full stack application for school and studying puroposes. The API in the backend is built using Python, Django, and PSQL. The API has three models and two associations. The user model is associated to the subject model and the subject model is associated to the topic model. There is Create, Read, Update, and Destroy (CRUD) functionality built throughout the application models. In the frontend JavaScript and Vue.js are used to connect and leverage the backend API. While HTML and CSS are used for styling and organization purposes. The fronend also has a responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktops. 

## Wireframes

Below are links to wireframes that show the application blueprint for mobile, tablet, and desktop display sizes.

## Time/Priority Matrix 

Here is a full list of features that have been [prioritized](https://res.cloudinary.com/dssciwyew/image/upload/v1599935146/Priority%20Matrix%20Frontend%20P4.png) using a `Time and Priority` Matix. 

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  The contents in the MVP list are expect to be implemented and functioning upon project completion.  

#### MVP

- Navigation Bar
- Sign In Modal
- Input Modal 
- Table/Chart
- Vue.js
- CSS/Bootstrap
- Responsive design
- Hamburger menu

#### PostMVP 

- Login page
- Footer

## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections, the logic is broken down further into functional components.

#### MVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Hamburger | L | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Navigation Bar | M | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Sign In Modal | H | 2hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Input Modal | H | 2hrs| -hr | -hr |
| Table/Chart | H | 4hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Vue.js | H | 6hrs| -hr | -hr |
| CSS/Bootstrap | M | 2hrs | -hr | -hr|
| Responsive design | M | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Total | H | 19hrs| -hrs | -hrs |

#### PostMVP
| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invetsted | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Login page | M | 2hrs | -hrs | -hr|
| Footer | L | 1hr | -hr | -hr|
| Total | H | 3hrs| -hrs | -hrs |
